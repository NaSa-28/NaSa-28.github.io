<h3>Explaining my projects</h3>
<p>1/21/25<p>
<p> 1. My first project is a sort of drawing game were you can click the squares to make them into circles and make a drawing out of them.  <p>
<p> 2. Just gives and error prompt when you click on the page.  <p>
<p> 3. I meant to make a present for my grandfather but I could never figure out how to make the images appear over the boxes. But right now one green box appears every little increment of time. <p>
<p> 4. This project has 2 shapes traveling in different random ways.  <p>
<p> 5. My best project, a slot machine. However I want to make each individual icon it's own point value  <p>
<p> 6. An unfinished jumpscare that is quite confusing. <p>
<p> 7. An early project that changes the color of a square when the screen is clicked.  <p>
<p> 8. An idea for my homepage that I worked on with Molly in a lab.  <p>
